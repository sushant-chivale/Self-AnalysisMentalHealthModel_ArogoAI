# Self-Analysis Mental Health Model

## Overview
This project has been deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed at:
[Self-Analysis Mental Health Model](https://self-analysis-mental-health-model-arogoai.streamlit.app/)

This project develops a **Self-Analysis Mental Health Model** that predicts possible mental health conditions based on user-provided symptoms. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms (Random Forest & XGBoost) and integrates an **LLM-based explanation system** to provide insights and coping mechanisms. A **Streamlit-based UI** is implemented for user interaction.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the **Depression and Anxiety Data** dataset from Kaggle:
[Depression and Anxiety Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahzadahmad0402/depression-and-anxiety-data/data)

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest & XGBoost trained to predict the `suicidal` column.
- **LLM Integration:** Provides explanations for predictions and suggests coping mechanisms.
- **Streamlit UI:** Allows users to input symptoms and receive predictions and explanations.
- **SHAP for Interpretability:** Feature importance and impact on predictions.
